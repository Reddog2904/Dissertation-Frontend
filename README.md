# Programmable Trading Bot Dissertation Project
This is the repository for my final year dissertation project. This repository contains the frontend code for a programmable trading bot.

## Project Overview
This project explores the integration of traditional valuation models within a trading bot, designed to operate in a simulated environment. The bot is programmed to execute trades over a customisable period, using customisable rules to evaluate its performance.

## Core Features
1. **Simulated Trading**: Executes trades in a controlled, simulated environment allowing for performance evaluation without financial risk.
2. **Customizable Rules**: Users can define and modify trading rules, which the bot uses to make trading decisions.
3. **Performance Analysis**: After the trading period, the bot analyses the outcomes of its trades based on the set rules and compiles results for further reporting.

## Disclaimer
This project is for academic purposes only and should not be used as a financial trading tool in real-world environments.

Thank you for your interest in this project!
